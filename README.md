Terminal Key-Logging Demonstration (Ethical & Educational)

This project is a Python-based terminal key-logging demonstration created as part of my cybersecurity internship at SkillCraft Technology.
It is designed purely for learning, awareness, and defensive understanding, not for malicious or hidden keylogging.
The program captures user-entered text inside the terminal only, logs it with timestamps, and saves it to a structured log file.

This repository aims to help security learners understand how logging works, why keyloggers pose a threat, and how to defend against them.

📌 Project Objectives

Demonstrate how keystroke logging works in a controlled and ethical environment

Understand input handling, timestamping, and secure file logging in Python

Build awareness of how attackers misuse keyloggers

Encourage safe practices, detection techniques, and defensive strategies

Provide a clean, professional, beginner-friendly repository for cybersecurity learning

🛠️ Features

📝 Logs user-typed terminal input

⏱ Adds accurate timestamps for each entry

📁 Saves logs to a structured text file (keylog.txt)

📷 Includes PNG assets for documentation and demonstration

🔒 User-aware and ethical (not hidden, not background-based)

🧭 Simple and suitable for cybersecurity beginners

🧩 How It Works

The user runs the Python script in the terminal.

The script displays a clear message informing the user that input will be logged.

Each entered line is captured and appended to keylog.txt along with a timestamp.

The session ends when the user types EXIT.

This provides a safe and transparent demonstration of the keylogging concept without violating ethical boundaries.

Ethical & Legal Notice

This project is strictly for educational purposes, demonstrating how keylogging works in a transparent environment.

It must not be modified or used for:

- unauthorized data capture

- spying

- credential theft

- surveillance

- penetration without consent

- Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical.
