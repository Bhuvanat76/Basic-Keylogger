# Terminal Typing Logger Demo

This project is a **safe, educational** demonstration of basic key logging concepts.
It runs in a terminal and records everything the user types into a log file
called `keylog.txt`, along with timestamps.

## How it works

- Prompts the user in the terminal.
- For each line the user types, the program appends it to `keylog.txt`.
- The session ends when the user types `EXIT`.

## Ethical note

This program does **not** run in the background or secretly capture keystrokes.
It is meant purely to understand input handling and logging. Misuse of
keylogging techniques for stealing passwords or private data is illegal and unethical.
